# Oliver Pluff & Company Creative Brief

This project was created for educational purposes only and does not pertain to the actual Oliver Pluff & Company in any way.

### Company Overview

Established in 2009, Oliver Pluff & Company provides a range of packaged tea, coffee, and spice blends originating from the same tea gardens that supplied the British East India Company from the early seventeenth to the late nineteenth centuries in the Americas.

The company serves as the main tea supplier for Colonial Williamsburg and its products can be found at over 200 other historic sites around the United States including Monticello, Mount Vernon, and Yosemite National Park. History buffs and tea aficionados can also purchase the company's products at select retailers in Charleston, South Carolina or online at http://www.oliverpluff.com/. All products are made in the United States and are packaged by hand in Charleston, South Carolina.


### SWOT Analysis

The company's strengths include:
- Its unique product offerings

- Its partnerships with several historic sites
- Its appeal to history enthusiasts

The company's weaknesses include:
- Its lack of branding

- Its need for additional retail sellers
- Its need to create a more modern identity

The company's opportunities include:
- Collaborations with other companies, such as lemonade producers

- If another company were to become Colonial Williamsburg's main tea supplier, it would lose a lot of its business.
- Its products are dependent on environmental conditions.
