# Oliver Pluff & Company Creative Brief

### Company Overview

Established in 2009, Oliver Pluff & Company provides a range of packaged tea, coffee, and spice blends originating from the same tea gardens that supplied the British East India Company from the early seventeenth to the late nineteenth centuries in the Americas.

The company serves as the main tea supplier for Colonial Williamsburg and its products can be found at over 200 other historic sites around the United States including Monticello, Mount Vernon, and Yosemite National Park. History buffs and tea aficionados can also purchase the company's products at select retailers in Charleston, South Carolina or online at http://www.oliverpluff.com/. All products are made in the United States and are packaged by hand in Charleston, South Carolina.
